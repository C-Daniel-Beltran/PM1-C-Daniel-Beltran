This project is a web application built using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on delivering an interactive user experience, leveraging the power of modern front-end development practices. The application is designed to be lightweight and fast, ensuring accessibility across various devices and browsers.

To ensure the reliability and maintainability of the codebase, the project incorporates Jasmine (version 5.2.0) as the testing framework. Jasmine is used for writing and running unit tests, enabling the development of robust and bug-free JavaScript code. The inclusion of automated testing helps maintain high code quality and facilitates future updates and enhancements.

Key Features:

HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web application.

CSS: Handles the styling, layout, and visual design, ensuring a polished and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript: Adds interactivity, dynamic content, and client-side functionality.

Jasmine (v5.2.0): Enables comprehensive testing of JavaScript code to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.

This project is ideal for developers looking to create a modern, test-driven web application using fundamental web technologies. It serves as a strong foundation for building scalable and maintainable front-end solutions.
